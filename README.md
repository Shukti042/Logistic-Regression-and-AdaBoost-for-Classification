# Logistic Regression and AdaBoost for Classification

In ensemble learning, we combine decisions from multiple weak learners to solve a classification problem. In this project, I have implemented  a Logistic Regression (LR) classifier and used it within AdaBoost algorithm.

## Programming Language/Platform

- <u>***Python 3***</u>

## Dataset

Demonstrated the performance and efficiency of my implementation for the following three different datasets.
